# Customize umbrella

## You have to create an umbrella customizer for an umbrella seller. The seller offers these umbrellas in multiple colors and the corporate brands are their main customers. These brands want the seller to print their logo on the umbrella. The seller wants you to create a tool that'll help their customers create an instant preview of the customized umbrella on the website by adding the logo.

## The customizer tool will let the brand upload its logo and will create a preview by adding the logo to the bottom of the umbrella. The umbrella is available in multiple colors and a user can change the color using color swatch buttons. On selecting the color of the umbrella, the theme of the whole customization tool changes, and the umbrella in new color loads. You can find all these details of the customizer tool in the demo photos and video below. You have to recreate the design and functionality as shown in the demo.

### Done using pure JS, HTML and CSS added all the properties and tried to make it similar to the one provided.

# Fly me to my destination - It's urgent!!

## Consider there are **N** airports in the world, each airport has a plane available with limited units of fuel available to fly.

## You are initially positioned at airport **number one** and you have to reach the last airport (**N**) by hiring a **minimum** number of planes. You'd need 1 unit of fuel to fly to the nearest airport from any airport.

## You will be given an array of N numbers each representing the units of fuel available in the plane at that particular airport. Print the number of planes you'd need to hire to reach the last airport. If it is not possible to reach the last airport, return -1

### Implemented the code using vanilla js, with TC: O(n^2) and SC: O(n), applied greedy approch. (run using Node Fly_my_destination/App.js).
